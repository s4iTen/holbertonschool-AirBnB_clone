#### AirBnB Clone Project
This project is a clone of the AirBnB website that consists of multiple parts, each representing a particular segment of the project.

Repository Structure
models/: This directory contains the implementation of the models that the project uses. It has a separate file for each model, including a base model that all other models inherit from.
tests/: This directory contains the tests that verify the correctness of the implementation of the models.
console.py: This file implements a command line interpreter that allows users to interact with the models via a command-line interface.
README.md: This file contains the documentation for the project.
AUTHORS: This file contains the list of contributors to the project.

### Models

## BaseModel
The BaseModel class serves as the parent class for all other classes in the project. It defines the basic attributes and methods that all other classes use, such as id, created_at, updated_at, and to_dict().

## FileStorage
The FileStorage class is responsible for serializing and deserializing instances of the models to and from a JSON file. It uses a dictionary to store all instances of the models, where the keys are the names of the classes and the IDs of the instances, and the values are the instances themselves.

## User
The User class represents the users of the AirBnB website. It has attributes such as email, password, first_name, and last_name.

## State
The State class represents the states of the United States. It has an attribute name.

## City
The City class represents the cities in a state. It has attributes such as state_id (the ID of the state that the city is in) and name.

## Amenity
The Amenity class represents the amenities that can be provided in a place. It has an attribute name.

## Place
The Place class represents the places that are available for rent on the AirBnB website. It has attributes such as city_id (the ID of the city where the place is located), user_id (the ID of the user who owns the place), name, description, number_rooms, number_bathrooms, max_guest, price_by_night, latitude, longitude, and amenity_ids (a list of the IDs of the amenities provided in the place).

## Review
The Review class represents the reviews that users can leave for a place. It has attributes such as place_id (the ID of the place that the review is for), user_id (the ID of the user who left the review), and text (the text of the review).

## Console
The console.py file implements a command-line interpreter that allows users to interact with the models via a command-line interface. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete instances of the models using commands such as create, show, all, update, and destroy.

## Testing
The tests/ directory contains the tests that verify the correctness of the implementation of the models. The tests are implemented using the unittest module and cover all of the public methods of the classes.

To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory of the project:

sh
Copy code
python3 -m unittest discover tests
